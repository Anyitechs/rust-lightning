* The `AvailableBalances::balance_msat` field has been removed in favor of `ChainMonitor::get_claimable_balances`. `ChannelDetails` serialized with versions of LDK >= 0.0.125 will have their `balance_msat` field set to `next_outbound_htlc_limit_msat` when read by versions of LDK prior to 0.0.125 (#3243).
