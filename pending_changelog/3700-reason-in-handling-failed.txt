## API Updates (0.2)

* The `HTLCHandlingFailed` event was updated to include a `failure_reason` field that provides
  additional information about why the HTLC was failed.
* The `failed_next_destination` field, which previously contained a combination of failure
  and HTLC-related information, was renamed to `failure_type` and the `UnknownNextHop`
  variant was deprecated. This type will be represented as `InvalidForward` for nodes
  downgrading from v0.2.0.
