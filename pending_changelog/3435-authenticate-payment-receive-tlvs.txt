## API Updates
 * Payment `ReceiveTlvs` now contains an `authentication` field. It should be
   set to `None` and then filled in with a nonce and the HMAC produced by
   `ReceiveTlvs::hmac_for_offer_payment` when passing in the nonce (#3435).

## Backwards Compatibility
 * `ReceiveTlvs` for payments over `BlindedPaymentPath`s are now authenticated.
   Any inbound payments for a preexisting `Bolt12Invoice` will therefore fail
   (#3435).
