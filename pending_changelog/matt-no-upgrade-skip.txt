## Backwards Compatibility
 * Nodes with pending forwarded HTLCs or unclaimed payments cannot be
   upgraded directly from 0.0.123 or earlier to 0.1. Instead, they must
   first either resolve all pending HTLCs (including those pending
   resolution on-chain), or run 0.0.124 and resolve any HTLCs that were
   originally forwarded or received running 0.0.123 or earlier.
