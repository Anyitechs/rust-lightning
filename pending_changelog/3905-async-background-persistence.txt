## API Updates (0.2)

* The `Persister` trait has been removed, and `KVStore` is now used directly. If you're persisting `ChannelManager`,
`NetworkGraph`, or `Scorer` to a custom location, you can maintain that behavior by intercepting and rewriting the
corresponding namespaces and keys.

* The `KVStore` trait has been updated to be asynchronous, while the original synchronous version is now available as
`KVStoreSync`. For channel persistence, `KVStoreSync` is still mandatory. However, for background persistence, an
asynchronous `KVStore` can be provided optionally.
