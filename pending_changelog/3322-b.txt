API Updates
===========

As a part of adding robustness against several unlikely scenarios, redundant `PaymentClaimed`
`Event`s will be generated more frequently on startup for payments received on LDK 0.1 and
newer. A new `Event::PaymentClaimed::payment_id` field may be used to better differentiate
between redundant payments.
